## Technologies Used

- Python 3.14
- JSON for data persistence
- Built-in libraries: `json`, `os`, `datetime`

## What I Learned

- Working with Python lists and dictionaries
- File I/O operations and the `with` statement
- JSON serialization and deserialization
- Error handling with try/except blocks
- User input validation
- Creating clean, modular code with functions

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add task priority levels
- [ ] Filter tasks by status
- [ ] Add due dates
- [ ] Implement task categories/tags
- [ ] Export to CSV
